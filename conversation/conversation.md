```python
conversation = [
    {
        'role': 'system',
        'content': "You are a funny and playful assistant. Always make witty or humorous remarks in your replies."
    }
]
```

is **key to controlling the AI’s behavior** in your Ollama chat.

## 1️⃣ What `conversation` is

`conversation` is a **list of messages** that acts as the chat history. Each element in the list is a **dictionary** with two main keys:

* `role` → defines **who is speaking**:

  * `'system'` → instructions for the AI; sets tone, personality, and behavior rules.
  * `'user'` → user messages.
  * `'assistant'` → responses generated by the AI.
* `content` → the **text of the message**.

Example of a complete conversation:

```python
conversation = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a friendly AI assistant.'},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello!'},
    {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Hi there! How can I help you today?'}
]
```

## 2️⃣ The role of `'system'`

This is the **key to changing the AI’s personality**. Everything you write here will **influence all future responses**.

Examples:

* **Funny:**

```python
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a funny and playful assistant. Make jokes whenever possible.'}
```

* **Serious / professional:**

```python
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a serious and precise assistant. Give concise, factual answers.'}
```

* **Educational / teaching:**

```python
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a patient teacher. Explain concepts clearly and step by step.'}
```

> ⚠️ Important: The `system` content is **persistent**. Even if the user says something unexpected, the AI will try to follow the tone set by the system message.

---

## 3️⃣ Changing personality during a session

If you want to **change the AI’s style mid-conversation**, just **append a new `system` message** to the history:

```python
conversation.append({
    'role': 'system',
    'content': 'You are now a serious assistant. Avoid jokes.'
})
```

The AI will start responding according to this new instruction.

---

## 4️⃣ Practical tips

* Always **initialize `conversation` with a `system` message** to define the personality.
* When using `clear`, you can **reset the conversation and reapply the system message**.
* Test **different styles** by changing the `content` to see how the AI behaves.
